# API catalogue data source

Currently the [API catalogue](https://github.com/co-cddo/api-catalogue) is built using a CSV file that we manually update.
Eventually we want to pull in this metadata from a JSON endpoint using the [federated model of API discovery](https://github.com/co-cddo/federated-api-model).
As an intermediary step we're converting the data in the CSV file into JSON and storing it in this repository, to show how it can work with the data in this format and being pulled in from an external source.
